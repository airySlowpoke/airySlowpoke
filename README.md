🌺 Howdy, I’m @airySlowpoke. Most of my stuff here are just personal projects to facilitate my own learning.
Hopefully in the future, I can provide something more to the community!

🖌️ I like to create pixel art, so I'm working on creating custom Pokemon sprites based on my own ideas and designs.
I'm currently learning how to script, edit maps, and create tilesets for Pokemon ROM hacking.

✉️ If you have any questions about the stuff you see here, feel free to each out to me at: airyslowpoke@gmail.com
